# My VSCode notes

## Sync between computers (without SettingsSync via GitHub)  

For my personal projects I use SettingsSync via GitHub, but if you need to sync your settings and extensions without using third-party services, here's how to do that:

1. Copy your settings files that are there in the directory `~/.config/Code/User/` (like `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, perhaps `snippets` too) from one machine to another.  
2. Install all extensions by pasting into the terminal shell the contents of the file vscode_extensions (this file can be created by CLI: `code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension >> vscode_extensions`).  
3. Set up `zsh` (`~/.zshrc` + custom setting for the theme's prompt â€“ see my_zsh_notes).  

## Python virtual envs and interpreter  

I prefer `poetry`.

### Selecting Interpreter for the virtual environment  

If you encounter `import could not be resolved` error after you created and activated the virtual environment and installed a library that you want to import, then you probably have to select correct interpreter for this env and folder:  
1. Execute `which python` in terminal in your activated virtual env and copy the output.  
2. Open `Command Pallette`.  
3. Type `Select Interpreter`.  
4. Select your folder that you need to select interpreter for.  
5. Select `Enter interpreter path`.  
6. Paste the path from the 1st step into prompt and hit Enter.  
7. Restart VS Code.  

## Using VSCode as your Git editor, difftool, and mergetool  

Taken from https://www.roboleary.net/vscode/2020/09/15/vscode-git.html

Why should you make VS Code your default Git Editor, Diff Tool, or Merge Tool?  
Itâ€™s a personal choice! There are many, many options out there. Above all else, your tools should complement your workflow and not impede you.  
Iâ€™ll explain my decision and maybe it will give your some insight in to understanding what works best for you. In a sentence, I prefer to do as much as I can in my code editor.  
Here are the situations where I have encountered friction or have an alternate preference:  
1. If I am executing an interactive git command that requires input from me to edit and review a chunk of text, I would prefer to stay in my code editor and stay in the same mental mode.  
2. I havenâ€™t used some of the Linux command-line tools associated with Git such as Nano enough to get the necessary muscle memory, I forget the commands! ðŸ™ˆ It can be a flow-buster.  
3. I prefer less switching between applications generally. I would prefer to switch to another tab of my code editor rather than a separate window.  
4. For diffing, I prefer viewing it in a GUI-based editor.  
5. Some merge conflicts are demanding, I like to jump to source files to get the complete picture, I can use familiar shortcuts if I can do it in VS Code.  
6. If I can do it all in my code editor, I have a consistent colour theme without further configuration.  

### Make VSCode your default Git editor

`git config --global core.editor 'code --wait'`  

If you prefer that a new window opens each time, add the `--new-window` code flag:
`git config --global core.editor 'code --wait --new-window'`  

If you only want to change it for your current project, run the same command without the `â€“global` git flag.  

Unhappy and want to go back?  
`git config --global --unset core.editor`  

### Make VS Code your default Diff Tool  

`git config --global diff.tool vscode`  
`git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE'`  

This adds the following settings to your global `Git config`:
```
[diff]
	tool = vscode
[difftool "vscode"]
	cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
```

If youâ€™re not feeling VS Code as your Diff Tool, you run the command `git difftool --tool-help` to see more options.  

### Make VS Code your default Merge Tool

`git config --global merge.tool vscode`  
`git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'`  

This adds the following settings to your global `Git config`:
```
[merge]
    tool = vscode
[mergetool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait $MERGED
```

You can paste this in yourself if you prefer.

If youâ€™re not feeling VS Code as your Merge Tool, you run the command `git mergetool --tool-help` to see more options.  

## Themes and Colors

Terminal colors for VSCode:
https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/brewer

Most beautiful themes:
- Andromeda (doesn't support color highlighting dicts, sets, lists)
- Monokai Pro (too much of red color - for, in, =, >, but highlights all methods and objects). I use it, but changed background color to full black (`"editor.background": "#000000"`, previously was grey), and also terminal font to Hack. Also set up different custom color highlighting (got on Stackoverflow) â€“ you better set all custom colors and settings specifically for the given color theme - see these parts in my `vscode_settings.md`:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Monokai]": {
        "strings": "#ffbb00",
        "textMateRules": [
            {
                "scope": "meta.function-call.generic.python",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#F2777A",
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
},
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[Monokai]": {
...
        }
}
```

## Custom settings

For the actual settings see `settings.json`

### Change tabs with `ctrl+tab` without dropdown menu

Use the `Command Palette` withÂ `CTRL+SHIFT+P`, enter `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`, and hitÂ Enter.

```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[
// ...
{
"key": "ctrl+tab",
"command": "workbench.action.nextEditor"
},
{
"key": "ctrl+shift+tab",
"command": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
}
]
```

### Fix Alt key behavior for some zsh plugins

For some `zsh` plugins (like `dircycle`, `dirhistory`) to work you have to specify the following setting in `settings.json`:

```json
"terminal.integrated.sendKeybindingsToShell": true // otherwise it will not work (due to the Alt key integrated terminal bindings).
```

### Auto copy selected text from terminal to clipboard

Add `"terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection": true`, to be able have the selected text automatically copied to the clipboard.

### Make diff colors more distinct

```json
"diffEditor.removedTextBackground": "#FF000055",
"diffEditor.insertedTextBackground": "#ffff0055"
```
### How many lines are shown above/below cursor

Use `editor.cursorSurroundingLines` to control how many lines are shown above/below the cursor as it moves towards the boundaries of the editor window (I'm using 4. default is 0).

## Vscode hotkeys

You can simply rename a symbol (function name, class name, etc.) by placing your cursor there and pressing `F2`. it will then replace it in all references too

Navigation: `Ctrl+Shift+.` or `Ctrl+R` (in command pallette)

`Alt + click` to set multiple cursor in different places
`Ctrl + X` - instead of `Ctrl+Shift+K` to delete a line!
`Ctrl + L` - highlight a line and then a line below it!
`Ctrl + F2` - select all occurrenceS in a file (like multiple `Ctrl+D`)

Code Folding at various levels:
`cmd + K + n` - fold code at `n` level; `cmd+K+1`, `cmd+K+2`, 3, 4....
`cmd + K + J` - expand all lines of code.

**Multi-cursor**

Found on the internet
```
`Find in selection` feature is also highly useful. If you highlight some code, press Ctrl+f to open the search menu, then you can press `Alt+l` to only search in the highlighted area.

My favorite productivity tip aside from making my own custom keyboard short cuts is using multiple cursors -  you hold down the Alt key and click somewhere, youâ€™ll put down a new cursor. Each cursor will accept the same key commands at the same timeâ€”a handy way to enter boilerplate text on multiple lines at once, for example.

Another way to add cursors is to hold Ctrl+Alt and press the up or down arrow keys. Doing so will insert cursors in the lines above or below the current oneâ€”useful for working in columns of text.

Another slick move: You can insert a cursor at every instance of a selected piece of text by hitting Ctrl-Shift-L. You can also control the selection size of multiple cursors by pressing Shift-Alt and the left or right arrow.
